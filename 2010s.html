            Season 1 was extremely mid until episode 16, then we woke up. The rest of s1 was good, very high
            highs. Season 2 after episode 4 was peak animation, no question about it. Season 2 is probably the best
            anime to come out that year. Season 3 was kinda mid. Season 2 is undoubtedly the best season.

            I watched this when I first started watching anime so I probably would rate it differently if I
            watched it again. The issue is definitely the episodes where nothing happens, but otherwise it's
            a phenomal anime that captures the competitive feeling you get from sports. I kinda related to it,
            as I used to compete in sports as well, and it gave me a similar feeling.

            A very funny show (and manga). I have a soft spot for comedy anime. It also had one emotional
            moment. There isn't much of a story or goal of this story, and the ending of the anime got confusing,
            but I liked the overall vibes and conept that the show gave.

            I would not give this a 10 if I watched it again (I could not watch all those episodes), 
            but I watched it during college apps during COVID, so it was fine. It is the most well-rounded
            show that has mostly everything you want from an anime. There's hype moments, there's sad moments,
            the world-building is amazing, there is character development. Some moments are extremely slow though.

          <p>
            A very funny show. I watched the first season (or 2?) during COVID, so I definitely enjoyed
            those more than the more recent ones that got released despite those being rated higher. Overall,
            a decently funny show (although most comedy anime are hard hit or miss).

          <p>
            For season 2, in 12 episodes, it gives me a similar vibe to HxH with encapsulating most of what 
            you look for in an anime: hype moments, sad moments, amazing fight scenes, character development. 
            Season 1 was also great. Season 3 was good, but I watched it more recently when I wasn't as into
            anime, so that brought down the score a little.

            The very first anime I watched that I realized was anime. I remember using a very roundabout 
            way to watch it that included using a free VPN trial, even though I now know there are better
            and more convenient alternatives to watch. A good, emotional movie with a good soundtrack.

            Probably my second favorite comedy anime. It has a unique sense of humour (there's a word for it, 
            but I don't know what), so I didn't get into it until episode 6. Otherwise, it is an 
            extremely charming show. It is also very well animated (Kyoto Animation).

            The first season tickles the itch you get from making complicated things from simple items.
            The second season is absolute hot dog water. I would only recommend the first season.

            Overall a funny show. I don't know if I would like it if I rewatched it, but when I first watched
            it, I remember laughing a lot, so that's why I gave it this score. I don't have much else to say
            about this show.

          <p>
            This is probably my favorite comedy show (and manga). Every episode made me laugh at least once.
            The setting is also during college, which may or may not be somewhat relatable. However, I would
            not recommend this to people who don't enjoy crass humour.

            To be completely honest, I don't remember much about the show in terms of the plot. I also
            only watched the first season. However, this show has the best anime antagonist period. That's
            why it gets the score it gets.

            It definitely creeped me out when I watched it. I like the fantasy aspect, and I respect the
            psychological horror aspect, although it isn't what I prefer.

            One of the first anime I watched. I had no idea what was happening when I was watching it because
            I didn't understand the anime formula yet, but it made me feel emotions and stuff, so that's why
            it gets the score it does.

          <p>
            I don't remember when or why I watched this show. It's just a slice of life, but I didn't
            really care about any of the characters at all. The setting, while unique, didn't really
            do it for me.

            I watched this after Your Name, and it is not as good as Your Name. The show, while still solid,
            made me uncomfortable at times (the bullying scenes). The ending scene is still touching, nonetheless.

          <p>
            I really liked this show and the soundtrack. It's about a group of people wanting to explore, and
            it really hit an itch because I watched this during the pandemic. It was also emotional, which is a 
            plus. Overall, a really solid show that I recommend if you want to get that nervous excitement feeling 
            from wanting to adventure.
          </p>

      <div class="anime-card">

          <h3>Violet Evergarden</h3>
          <span class="fa fa-star checked"></span><span class="score seven">  7.5</span><span>/10</span>
          <p>
            To be honest, I did not get that emotional watching this anime, as opposed to some other people.
            It's mainly due to the fact that I didn't really care about the main character. However, the shading 
            and art makes me describe this anime as "art in motion", so if you want to see pretty things, this 
            is where it's at.
