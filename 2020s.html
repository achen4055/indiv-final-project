            Some people didn't really like this show, but I personally enjoyed the concept. Season 2 definitely 
            stretched the realm of possibility, however. Season 1 is good though, and I would recommend 
            if you have Netflix.

            I would like to preface that this show is not for everyone, as there are some inappropriate and 
            sensitive moments. However, the world building and fantasy aspect is unmatched. This is peak 
            anime fantasy. If you enjoyed stuff like Lord of the Rings, then this may scratch that fantasy itch 
            (although if you haven't watched anime before, this will probably turn you away from it).

            This is a new show that is coming out at the making of this website, and I have not caught up, so I 
            have only watched five episodes. However, this show is similar to Mushoku in that it is a good fantasy, 
            although it is much slower and there is no urgency. It is a show you watch when you want to get that 
            calm feeling and just sink into your couch and feel zen.

            I watched the first ten or so episodes of season 1, and I am not a fan. I just don't care about 
            the characters to be honest, which makes it hard to get into a slice of life show like this. The 
            castle scene was cool though.

            I have not finished watching this show, but from what I have watched, it is a show that started 
            with an extremely promising first episode and is slowly losing its charm across the episodes. If I 
            keep watching, then I might end up liking or hating it more, but this is where I stand at the moment.

            This show is bad. I don't know how I watched 16 episodes of this. I do not recommend. It makes no 
            sense why the characters are middle schoolers. It just seems completely nonsensical and 
            unnecessary.

            This is a solid mystery show that actually has a conclusive ending (unlike the majority of anime). 
            Do not be turned off by the anthropomorphic characters. It is a good show. I also like the opening 
            song.

            This was just an unremarkable show. I don't remember much about it. It was extremely mid, 
            and I didn't find anything outstanding about it. It just didn't feel like it was worth my time 
            watching, although some people did like it.

            One of the only semi-mature romance anime shows. It is very wholesome and a solid show. If you 
            enjoy high school romance, then this is a good show to watch. Some parts are really rushed though, 
            so it doesn't make the most sense.

            The concept is very interesting, and the characters are also very interesting. I enjoyed the 
            fact that I didn't know what was going on in the show because it kinda gave off that vibe. However, 
            the story wasn't anything remarkable or memorable.

            This is definitely one of the most popular shows as of the making of this review. Personally, I 
            enjoyed the latter part of season 1 more than the season 2 stuff I've seen so far, which is about 
            halfway through season 2. Overall, a solid action show that a lot of people are watching. Also, Gojo 
            is hot.

            The show is good, but it was overhyped to the moon, which made me not enjoy the show as much. It 
            definitely got better as the show went on, however. I don't think it is as good as something like 
            Jujutsu Kaisen yet, although I can see it being better when there is a larger story line and bigger 
            antagonist.
